# Spectro 100
_A census of high resolution spectroscopy for stars within 100 pc of the Sun_

High resolution optical specrta is crtical for understanding stellar properties (e.g. metallicity, age, galactocentric velocity), constraining binary companions, detecting exoplanet velocity shifts (particularly over long time periods), measuring magnetic activity indicators and constraining activity cycles, and searching for anomalies from e.g. laser technosignatures. 
As these data require bright stars, we are limited to systems that are relatively nearby... But how many nearby stars actually have high resolution data available?

My guess: shockingly few, at least from public archives. Le's find out, and make the case for getting a LOT more, particularly from existing archives!
